This is a syntax file for IBM's Einstimer tcl language

The syntaxing can handle optional arguments and all their legal abbreviations.
The command names themselves, however, have to be spelled out completely.
I haven't figured out a clean way of doing the command abbreviations.

This syntax file sources the standard tcl syntax file from the vim
release to do most of the tcl stuff.  I have just added the language-specific
extensions.  I'm not an expert in vim syntaxing, but they seem to work
reasonably well.  Send comments and suggestions to:
